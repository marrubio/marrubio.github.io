I'm Marrubio, currently shaping solution architecture at Sopra Steria Valencia. I guide teams through designing cloud-native platforms while keeping delivery human-centered with clear documentation and aligned collaboration.

## Specializations

- **Modern architectures:** microservices, event-driven platforms, and boundary-aware systems that adapt to evolving requirements.

- **DevOps:** automated pipelines, rehearsed deployments, and observability that let teams move fast with confidence.

## What defines me?

- **Relentless curiosity:** I test new tools, explore emerging patterns, and prototype to understand where they make sense.
- **Clear collaboration:** structured notes, async reviews, and frequent demos keep everyone aligned.
- **Pragmatic quality:** I deliver solutions that stay maintainable, scalable, and adaptable even with limited resources.
